//The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string
//where each character in the new string is "(" if that character 
// appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character 
// appears more than once in the original string. Ignore 
// capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
// eg. "din" => "(((" ,  recede => "()()()"

// pseudocode i) convert string into char array
// ii) count the number of occurences for each array
// iii) separate into single and non-single occurences
// iv) output ( for single occurence ) for non-single occurence
